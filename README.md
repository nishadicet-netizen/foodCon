FoodCon is a dynamic and intelligent food recipe recommendation web application designed to help users discover new dishes based on their taste preferences, dietary needs, and available ingredients. Built using Django for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the system provides a seamless and interactive platform for food lovers to explore a wide variety of recipes from around the world. FoodCon integrates the powerful Spoonacular API, which enables it to fetch thousands of real-world recipes along with nutritional details, cooking instructions, and ingredient lists, ensuring users get accurate and diverse recipe suggestions in real time.

Users can easily enter ingredients they have at home, and FoodCon instantly generates recipes that can be prepared using those items—helping minimize food waste and save time. It also allows filtering based on dietary preferences such as vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, and provides detailed nutritional insights like calories, fat, and protein content for every recipe. The application delivers a personalized cooking experience where users can explore, save, and revisit their favorite dishes anytime.

FoodCon includes key modules like User Authentication, Recipe Search, Ingredient-Based Recommendation, and Nutrition Analysis. The backend manages API integration and user sessions efficiently using Django’s secure and scalable framework, while the frontend ensures a smooth user experience with responsive design and intuitive navigation.

More than just a recipe finder, FoodCon acts as a personal cooking assistant, helping users make smarter food choices and encouraging healthy eating habits. Future enhancements include AI-based meal planning, voice-enabled recipe search, mobile app integration, and smart grocery suggestions based on the user’s selected recipes. With FoodCon, discovering new meals becomes effortless, enjoyable, and perfectly suited to every lifestyle.
